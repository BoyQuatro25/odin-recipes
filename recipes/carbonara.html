                <h3>Step1</h3>
                <p>
                    Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the
                    boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite,
                    about 12 minutes.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Step2</h3>
                    <p>
                        Meanwhile, place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high
                        heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes.
                        Drain bacon slices on paper towels. Reserve 2 tablespoons bacon fat in
                        the skillet and discard the rest. Chop bacon when cool enough to handle.
                    </p>
            </li>
                
            <li> 
                <h3>Step3</h3>
                <p>
                    Add 1 tablespoon olive oil and onion to reserved bacon fat in the skillet.
                    Cook over medium-high heat until the onion has softened and turned
                    translucent, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1
                    minute. Pour vermouth into the pan and bring to a boil while scraping
                    the browned bits of food off the bottom of the pan with a wooden
                    spoon, about 1 minute. Mix in chopped bacon.
                </p>
